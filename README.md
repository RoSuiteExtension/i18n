## Contributing
### Issues
Please do **NOT** make any issues for RoSuite. I **won't** read them and will just close them. If you want to make a bug report do that in the discord.
### Customizing Language Localization
Locate the `en` folder in the repository. This folder contains the English language localization files.

Duplicate and rename the new `en` folder to the appropriate [language locale](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) you wish to contribute to.

Inside the renamed folder, you'll find a `messages.json` file. Open this file using a text editor.

Edit the `messages.json` file and update the values according to your desired translation. Please ensure that you maintain the JSON structure and do not change the keys.
